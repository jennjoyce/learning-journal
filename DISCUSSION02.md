# Module 2 
## What I learned + advice for non techy people:

### The programs I installed for Lab 2
- **Ubuntu**
- **VSCode**  with extensions
- **Node.js**
- **Git**


### Terminal commands 


- `pwd` means Print Working Directory; This basically gives you a heads up as to where you are.
- `ls` list; gives a list of the items of the directory you are in
- `cd` change directory; change your "location"
- `touch` to make a file:  Example: touch=index.html makes an html file inside your directory
- `.` (full stop); hides a file
- `echo` used to display messages
- `-`  options start with a - (dash)
- `ls -a` lists hidden files
- `mkdir` make directory; makes a folder on the desktop
- `clear` clears your text

- use up and down arrow keys to view your history


### Other Noteworthy Items from Module 2 Videos
- Terminal tasks include: 
  * Find files & find content
  * Change directories
  * Move & copy files
  * Open a file
  * Make a new file 
  * Make a new directory


- Use camelCase when naming files. The computer doesn't know what to do w/ a blank space
- Everything is a file
- GUI means Graphical User Interface
- Code editors with extensions are valuable time & sanity savers.  Good extensions: Emmet, syntax highlighting, Boilerplate for themes
- Be sure to have *auto save* on for your text editor so you don't lose your work
- Absolute paths begin with a / (forward slash)
- The best code editor is the one that works for you and that you can understand how to use well

### Advice for non techy people and anyone learning a new skill:

* ***Understand your expectations:***
  * DeltaV did me a **HUGE** favor by stating this (I'm paraphrasing): "This lab will take you 3 hours. You will not understand what you are doing while doing the lab portion of this assignment. Follow it all step by step, line by line. Ask for help if you need it."
  * I was grateful for the idea of being ok with having no clue what I was doing or why.  I know I'll get there. Knowing ahead of time that it was ok for me to be confused and for it to not makes sense was very helpful. 
* ***Ask for help.***
  * Teachers want to help students.  Asking for help blesses everyone. You get to learn, they get to exercise their knowledge that they spent years obtaining just so they can help others.  
  * Be patient with the learning process.  These things take time and practice. No one became an expert at anything overnight.
