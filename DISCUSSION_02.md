# Things I learned from Module 2 and Advice for non techy people:

### Terminal commands 


- `pwd` means Print Working Directory; This basically gives you a heads up as to where you are.
- `ls` list; gives a list of the items of the directory you are in
- `cd` change directory; change your "location"
- `touch` basically means to make a file
- `.` (full stop); hides a file
- `echo` used to display messages
- `-`  options start with a - (dash)
- `lsa` lists hidden files
