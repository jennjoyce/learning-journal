# Things I learned from Module 2 and Advice for non techy people:

### Terminal commands 


- `pwd` means Print Working Directory; This basically gives you a heads up as to where you are.
- `ls` list; gives a list of the items of the directory you are in
- `cd` change directory; change your "location"
- `touch` to make a file:  Example: touch=index.html makes an html file inside your directory
- `.` (full stop); hides a file
- `echo` used to display messages
- `-`  options start with a - (dash)
- `lsa` lists hidden files
- `mkdir` make directory; makes a folder on the desktop
- `clear` clears your text

- use up and down arrow keys to view your history


### Other Noteworthy Items from Module 2 Videos
- Terminal tasks include: 
  * Find files & find content
  * Change directories
  * Move & copy files
  * Open a file
  * Make a new file 
  * Make a new directory


- Use camelCase when naming files. The computer doesn't know what to do w/ a blank space
- Everything is a file
- GUI means Graphical User Interface
- Code editors with extensions are valuable time & sanity savers.  Good extensions: Emmet, syntax highlighting, Boilerplate for themes
- Be sure to have *auto save* on for your text editor so you don't lose your work
- Absolute paths begin with a / (forward slash)
- The best code editor is the one that works for you and that you can understand how to use well
