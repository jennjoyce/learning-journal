# Things I learned from Module 1:

* Sit on a comfy chair, because you're in for an educational ride and the dining room chair is going to make your butt sore.
* Sift through all the information first and take good notes, THEN go back and do the assignments. (I'm a trial by fire kind of girl so I sometimes like non linear learning, but I think because this is all brand new, some linear/path learning will save me some time and effort?)
* I've literally never heard the word "repository" before. I had to use Google to find the [definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/repository).  
* Having some very light HTML/CSS and Python understanding is helpful. I am very grateful I had a chance to come in with some small measure of understanding of those topics before I even got to this point. 
* I've never used Github before. I can see how it would be useful.  I usually use WordPress, so I like the simplicity of building a webpage with Github. 
* I've spent lot of hours today doing homework already (maybe 6?) and I've made lots of "mistakes" which are really just curvy learning paths and not failures. 
* adding hyperlinks in Github is way easier than in HTML.
* I really love learning something new and stretching my brain in new ways.  This is going to be fun...and probably frustrating at times.
