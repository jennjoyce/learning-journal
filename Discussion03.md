# Revisions and the Cloud

* 
* I am currently working in VS on my computer. I will attempt to A-C-P to Git with Module 3 Assignement.


* Cloning a repository from the Cloud to your machine:

1) Open GitHub and find your selected repository and copy it.  (There's a gree rectangle button that says: "Copy or Download")
2) Once you have your link open your terminal and find out where you are on the command line by using: `pwd`
3) Once you know where you are, use the `ls` command to show your files.
4) You can change directories by using `cd` into your desired directory
5) Then you use the command `git clone FILENAME.md` to clone your repository,
6) After your repository has been cloned, you can open it by using this command: `code .`
7) When you are done editing your repository, you will have to "save" or A-C-P to get your local repository back to GitHub.
8) Use the command `git status` to see if all the software recognizes that changes have been made.
8) In your terminal (or in the View mode of your VS), use the command: `git add FILENAME.md`
9) Some red words should pop up indicating that changes are made. At this point you can commit to changes or decline the changes.
10) To commit: `git commit -m "describe your changes here...essentially a little caption of what you are changing"
11) Some words will turn green 
12) Command: `git push origin master`
13) Command: `git status`
14) Hopefully all the words are black and you will see a message that is boring to read but is very important.  It should say: "nothing to commit, working tree is clean"
13) Pop over to your URL and see if your changes updated.  Sometimes updating can take a minute so don't stress.


## Other tidbits and factoids I learned from the video:
*  Craig likes coffee, Craig does not like blisters. Break in your hiking boots well before you agree to eating lunch w/ the CEO of Codefellows. 
*  GitHub is like a shared Google drive among employees, a collection of people can access code files and make changes
*  A-C-P is a really fancy and complicated way of saving something on the Cloud
*  To make a check mark on MD use this: `[x]`

## Comments/Questions/Concerns I hope to have answered in the next videos and classes:
*  What's the benefit of using VS on my computer vs working in the Cloud?
    *  Currently I think I prefer using the Cloud b/c I can push that little preview button and see immediate changes in how things looks. 
*  What happens if I use the cloud but I need to update my local files? 
    *  I am guessing this is where `pull`, `fetch`, and `merge` come into play?
*  What happens if you don't want someone messing w/ your code on Github? Do you just make your repository private? For instance I have a friend who works for a company that is in    a lawsuit over some open source software. They make software for the insurance and financial industry....Surely not everything is up for grabs? 
*  Is there a preview button on VS code? I really want to see how things look before I commit to them.
