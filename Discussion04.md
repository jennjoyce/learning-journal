# Structure Web Pages with HTML from [Jon Duckett's Book](https://www.amazon.com/Web-Design-HTML-JavaScript-jQuery/dp/1118907442/ref=sr_1_3?__mk_es_US=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=jon+duckett+html&qid=1589403566&sr=8-3)

## Chapter 18 Process and Design 

* Who is your site for? You'll be tempted to show off your rad coding skills, but really you should build the site for your ideal user/avatar. Know your ideal customer's motivations and goals so you can give them the right information, in the right way, in the right format, at the right time. Reflect the public's understanding of the subject rahter than your own expertise on a subject.
* Use good design to draw people in and attract them to your site, use good content and UX to keep them coming back. 
* Be organized, not haphazard with your site's info and content.
* Use wireframing to make a plan that will help the user.  
* Wireframing tools can be done on paper or use tools found [online.](https://www.gomockingbird.com/home)
* I have _*so*_ much to say about design, as I just took a semester long web design class but I'll spare you all the details and just say that using these design elements is important:  
    * brand colors
    * fonts 
    * contrast
    * repitition
    * alignment
    * proximity 

## Chapter 1 Structure & Chapter 17 HTML Layout

* Important tags to know for website structure, use both opening and closing tags (also called elements). There are a few exceptions such as the `<image>` tag.
    * Opening tags look like this `<>`
    * Closing tags look like this `</>`
    * `<html>`  This tells your website that everything between the tags is for the website.
    * `<header>` This is the first tag after the `<html>` tag and contains info about the page. 
    * `<title>` This is the title of your site and shown in the browser
    * `<p>`  paragraph
    * There are also other tags like, `<body>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, `<article>`, `<list>` etc.
    
## Chapter 8 Extra Markup
 * It's important to add comments to your code so that you are not confused when you later go back to edit it. It's also helpful for others who will have to look at it so that they can edit it efficiently and without confusion. 
* Adding comments can be done like this: `<!--Make a comment here-->`
* Use ID & classes for changing things in CSS.
* ID is unique to the page, so only have one
* Many elements can be in a class
* Examples of block elements: 
    * `<h1>` - headings tags, also important for SEO
    * `<p>` - paragraph
    * `<li>` - lists 
* Examples of inline elements: 
    * `<a>` - the anchor tag 
    * `<b>` - makes your text bold
    * `<em>` - makes your text italics
    * `<img>` - an img tag - don't forget your source and alt tags as well with your image tag
* Other common and helpful tags: 
    * `<div>` this tag allows you to group elements together in one block-level box
    * `<span>` this element acts like an inline equivalent of the `<div>`.  It can contain a section of text or contain a number of inline elements.
