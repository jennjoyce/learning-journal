# Computer Architecture & Logic

## Notes from the YouTube videos:


# Computers do 4 things:
* They take input
* They store input
* They process input
* They output results

# Ways to input:
* Keyboard
* Mouse
* Touchscreen
* Voice
* Camera

# Ways to output:
* Text
* Video
* Images
* Speaker/Audio

# All input and output is binary - zeros and ones
* Numbers are binary
* Images/Pixels are binary
* Sound can be binary
* Text is binary 

# Other tidbits of info:
* a bit is the smallest piece of information
* zeros and ones are like switches....they can be on or off
* more bits equals more quality, 8 bits is the lowest quality (I think?) and 32 bits is higher quality
* computers hold and manipulate information
* they hold information in the CPU circuits
* computers have many circuits and they are tiny, which means the information only has to travel a small amount of distance, which means they can compute a lot of things really quickly
