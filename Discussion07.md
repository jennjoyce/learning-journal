# JavaScript Basics from [Jon Duckett's Book](https://www.amazon.com/Web-Design-HTML-JavaScript-jQuery/dp/1118907442/ref=sr_1_3?__mk_es_US=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=jon+duckett+html&qid=1589403566&sr=8-3) 

## Notes from the Book:


# JavaScript can do 4 things:
* Access Content
* Modify Content
* Program Rules
* React to Events

# What is a script?
* It is step by step instructions for a computer to execute

# How to write a script:
* State your goal
* Design the script (Make a flowchart on paper [online](https://www.smartdraw.com/flowchart/flowchart-maker.htm?id=45054&gclid=CjwKCAjw5Ij2BRBdEiwA0Frc9SIJgsYXSi69qg1ISX48GX0_JvhxTzdTzEElsavldpqwM4JPcP_qBRoCebcQAvD_BwE) )
* Code each step in a logical manner with instructions and language that a computer can understand
* Test and debug your program

# JavaScript vocabulary 
* _Function_ A group of statements blocks of code; it uses `{}`
* _Concatenation_ the process of joining 2 strings together to create one string. Concatenation uses this symbol: `+`.
* _Parameter_ information that is passed to a function
* _Return Value_ when you expect an answer from a function
* _String_ information that the computer uses to perform tasks.  
    *Strings are contained in `'` and can include numbers and letters.  Numbers that are strings cannot perform mathmatical processes and they are surrounded by `'`. Example: `42` is a string and not a number. 
* _Variable_ a place for JavaScript to hold data for later use


# Operators:
* `=` Assignment operator, not an equals sign.  
* `>` and `<` Comparison operator, can be used in conjunction with `=`
* `&&` Logical Operator - tests more than one condition. Example: I am a female and I am a mother = true
* `|| ` Logical Operator that means "or" Example: I am a female and I am not a mother = true (only one condition has to be true)
* ` !` Logical Operator that means "opposite" Example: I am a female = false.
* `*` Mathematical operator for multiplication
* `-` Mathematical operator for subtraction
* `+` Mathematical operator for addition
* `/` Mathematical operator for division
* `++` Mathematical operator for adding one to the current number 
* `--` Mathematical operator for subtracting one from the current number
* `%` Mathematical operator for diving two numbers and returning the remainder
* **NOTE** Follow the order of operations like in math class: 
    * First do Mulitiplication, then division, then addition, then subtraction
    * If something is in paratheses do that operation first

# Expressions:
* There are 2 types of expressions
    * Ex: var girl = 'Sally'  In this type of expression, we are assigning value to a variable
    * Ex: var sum = 100 + 50;  In this type of expression, we are using two values to return a single value

# Other tidbits:
* Arguments and Parameters are not the same
* Arguments can be a value or a variable
* Parameters are passed into functions, they act like variable names
* You call a function by using `()`  Ex: greetUser();
