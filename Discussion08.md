# JavaScript Loops from [Jon Duckett's Book](https://www.amazon.com/Web-Design-HTML-JavaScript-jQuery/dp/1118907442/ref=sr_1_3?__mk_es_US=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=jon+duckett+html&qid=1589403566&sr=8-3) 

## Notes from the Book:

## For Loops, While Loops, Do While Loops

### Loops check for conditions and if the condition is true, a properly written loop will run and it will repeat until the condition is false


## 3 kinds of loops: 

* For Loop:
    * the most common type of loop
    * this loop runs for a specific number of times
    * this loops uses a counter, usually an `i`

* While Loop:
    * this loop runs for an unknown # of iterations
    * this loop will run as long as the condition is true
    * this is where an infinite loop can occur, infinite loops are bad
    * infinite loops happen when conditions never return false

* Do While Loop:
    * this loop will run at least once, even if the condition is false


    
## Comparison Operators:

* Logical Operators: `&&` 
    * This tests more than one condition
    * If one expression returns false, the expression returns false
* Logical Operators: `||`
    * This tests at least one condition
    * If either condition evaluates to true, the expression is true
     * If both conditions evaluates to false, the expression is false
* Logical Not: `!`
        * This takes a single Boolean operator and inverts it 
        * example: !(5 > 100)   this will return true

## Tidbits:

* pages with a lot of loops and scripts will load slowly
