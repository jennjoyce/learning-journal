# Introduction
I am Jenn Joyce. Currently a student in **_NewboCo's Delta V 102 class._** I have 5 kids, a few part time jobs, and no pets, because I can live in a world with a lot of spinning plates....just not with four legs and fur. I drink my fair share of coffee with lots of French Vanilla creamer everyday.  I run half marathons and I love to watch the sunset over the Gulf of Mexico. I have a teaching degree from Iowa State University and I was able to do part of my student teaching in South Africa in a school with no running water or electricity. My life is very full and wonderful. Also, I drive a minivan....which is also full...of food wrappers and shoes and smashed french fries and random toys that my kids drag to the van and never seem to make it back into the house.

# What is growth mindset?

1. It is being a **life long learner**
2. It is realizing mistakes are a **path to an outcome, not failure**
3. It is taking initiative with **excellence and integrity**

# How to achieve a growth mindset?
* Ask for feedback from colleagues and mentors. 
  * Don't be discouraged with constructive criticism. 
  * It's meant to propel you forward and not allow you to get stagnant or lazy where you are at. 
* Realize that everyone starts somewhere.
  * What was really hard to learn today will become easier to learn tomorrow with practice.
* Reconginizing other's success does not mean you failed or aren't on your way to success as well.  
  * *Be a cheerleader.*
