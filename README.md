# What is growth mindset?

* It is being a life long learner
* It is realizing mistakes are a path to an outcome, not failure
* It is taking initiative with excellence and integrity

# How to achieve a growth mindset?
* Ask for feedback from colleagues and mentors. Don't be discouraged with constructive criticism. It's meant to propel you forward and not allow you to get stagnant or lazy where you are at. 
* Realize that everyone starts somewhere....what was really hard to learn today will become easier to learn tomorrow with practice.
* Reconginizing other's success does not mean you failed or aren't on your way to success as well.  *Be a cheerleader.*
